The Kennel Club of the Republic of Serbia promotes cynology, educates breeders, encourages responsible breeding, and works to preserve indigenous Serbian dog breeds. 
KSS is also a permanent member of the International Cynological Federation. The club brings together numerous kennel associations from across Serbia, 
advancing the country's cynology through well-organized events such as international and national exhibitions, specialized shows, competitions, and more.
Additionally, it provides ongoing education for kennel judges, supports the improvement of breeding quality for all breeds, and maintains precise pedigree records. 
To review and manage exhibition records, they use an application with a database, the structure of which is shown in the attached image.
